# NEA-Project-website

This workspace contains a minimal single-page website starter.

How to view locally
1. From the repository root run a simple HTTP server. For example with Python 3:

```
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

2. Open your browser to http://localhost:8000/ and you should see `index.html`.

Files added:
- `index.html` — main one-page site
- `assets/css/styles.css` — styling
- `assets/js/main.js` — small client-side behavior for the demo contact form

Customize the content in `index.html` and the styles in `assets/css/styles.css`.
